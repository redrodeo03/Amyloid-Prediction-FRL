# Amyloidogenic Patch Prediction Models

The accumulation of amyloid proteins is a key factor in a number of significant neurodegenerative illnesses, including **Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Mad Cow disease**. The aggregation rate is crucial in creating a quantitative description of the process and has a significant influence on how amyloidosis develops.

With varying degrees of success, different Machine Learning techniques have been used to monitor and forecast these aggregation patterns. Here, we investigate the two possibilities that are most accurate.
